In this laboratory you will write a BASH shell script that performs basic UNIX file management functions for DOS/Windows users not familiar with UNIX. The script will take DOS/Windows commands as the first parameter and perform the equivalent UNIX command

Operation:
- Unless specified in filename parameters the script will perform all work in the current directory
- The first parameter will be the DOS/Windows command the script will emulate ï‚· Subsequent parameters will be filenames upon which the script will operate such as:
  dosutil copy orig_file dest_file
